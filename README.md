# whisper-asr-webservice flake

This is a Nix flake to package [whisper-asr-webservice](https://github.com/ahmetoner/whisper-asr-webservice).

Don't touch anything. This was a massive headache to package, especially because poetry2nix is unmaintained and old. If upstream ever moves to something like uv, maybe we could redo this flake with uv2nix and avoid the headache and all the overrides. But right now, just leave it.
